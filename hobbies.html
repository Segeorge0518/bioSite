      <h2>Ray's Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Ray's hobbies include motorcycle riding, building and running gasoline-powered remote controlled race cars. He got his first motorcycle, a Kawasaki Z1000LTD, all the way back in 1981. He still has it today, and it still runs amazing for its age. Unfortunately, despite still being a great bike, it simply can't be trusted to go the long distances that it used to due to its age. Ray now has a new 2023 Kawasaki z900rs for long trips while the LTD is retired to in-town riding. Ray also enjoys building, customizing, and racing high-powered remote controlled race cars that are fueled by gasoline. More than riding motorcycles and racing remote controlled cars though he loves to play and hang out with his best buddy, a black boxer and labrador retriever mixed dog named Gunner. Before he had Gunner, Ray had a sweet yellow lab named Tucker. Tucker has Unfortunately crossed the rainbow bridge, and is still very missed.</p>
