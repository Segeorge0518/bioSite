        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>Raynor has worked over 30 years in the IT industry. Starting out as an electrical engineer for a small engineering firm, Ray transferred into the IT field in the mid 90’s after it became clear the internet was here to stay. When his firm decided to start moving their engineers from designing blueprints by hand to designing in engineering software, he was picked to head their IT department and add computer science to his electrical engineering degree. Currently Ray is looking forward to retirement. He hopes to move to the Smoky Mountains where he and his wife honeymooned after their wedding or to his favorite vacation spot, South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Ray’s skills include project management, system integration, cloud computing, and IT governance. He holds a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from Franklin University
        and maintains certifications in CISSP and PMP.
