      <h2>About Raynor</h2>
      <p>Raynor, who goes by Ray, is an IT manager who has been in the IT field for over 25 years. Prior to his work in IT, he worked as an electrical engineer for a engineering firm called <dfn>MEngineering</dfn> or simply <abbr>ME</abbr>. <!--The dfn and abbr elements are two elements we didn't cover in the course--> Electrical engineering was what he had originally obtained his degree in.At this time he was one of the few people trained in the use of AutoCad, as using computers for drafting was not common place. In fact, most of his coworkers were still hand drafting their designs. Due to his degree in electrical engineering, and adeptness with computers, his firm selected him for training and certifications necessary to become their first computer expert. Over the years Raynor has become the firm's first and only IT manager.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p>Outside of work, Ray has also spent a lot of time in martial arts. He obtained a brown belt in Karate, and a red belt in TaeKwonDo.</p>
